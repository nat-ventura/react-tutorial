import React from "react";

import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
// this is a rendering engine
// you don't even have to render to html-- could render to a string
// could render to the DOM (our active webpage)

// and the actual RENDERING ENGINE
// IS SEPARATE from the react syntax which makes your code versatile to native apps etc

// ==============

// first your going to make a layout component by extending the react component
// EVERYTHING IS A COMPONENT
// EVERYTHING IS AN ELEMENT IN HTML

class Layout extends React Component {
    // at the very basic-- you need a render method for a component
    render() {
        return (
            <h1>does it work?... i'll find out after webpack someday..</h1>
        );
    }
}

const app = document.getElementByID('app');

ReactDOM.render(<Layout/>, app);
