import React from "react";

import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
// this is a rendering engine
// you don't even have to render to html-- could render to a string
// could render to the DOM (our active webpage)

// and the actual RENDERING ENGINE
// IS SEPARATE from the react syntax
// which makes your code versatile to native apps etc

// ==============

// first your going to make a layout component or class
//  by extending the react component
// CORE CONCEPT::: EVERYTHING IS A COMPONENT
// if you look in index.html, everything is an element
// in REACT, everything is a component instead of an element

class Layout extends React.Component {
    // at the very basic-- you need a render method for a component
    // the render method says what we're spitting out
    render() {
        return (
        // the jsx part of it (scary at first)--
        // anything wrapped in parens can CONVERT HTML TO JS TO CREATE AN ELEMENT
            <h1>does it work?... i'll find out after installing webpack..</h1>
        );
    }
}
// var div = document.createElement("div");
// div.innerHTML = "some content";
// jsx ^ transpiles to this stuff
// you're blending html and js but in a cool way
// js creates html elements all the time, and this makes it easy
// if you ever want to render a component-- you use it as if it were an HTML TAG****

const app = document.getElementByID('app');

ReactDOM.render(<Layout/>, app);
